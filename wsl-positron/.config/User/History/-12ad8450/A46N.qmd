## Purpose & Methods

Apply a five-step diabetes classification to our working NHANES cohort (2011-2022) 
[@mosslemi_2020]. The [methods](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7041875/) 
involve evaluating the NHANES responses as they relate to five questions:  
1. Is there valid diabetes-related information?  
2. Is the participant currently taking medication for diabetes?  
3. Is the participant currently taking insulin?  
4. Is the participant currently taking _only_ insulin?  
5. Has the participant started taking insulin within a year of diagnosis?

While some participants met multiple exclusion criteria, after preprocessing, there are 
`r nrow(step_0)` participants with a valid self-reported  previous diabetes diagnosis and 
valid disease duration information. We will continue using this cohort (*N*=
`r nrow(step_0)`).



### Step 1: Has valid diabetes-related information

"Participants who did not have a reply to treatment questions (DIQ.050, DIQ.060, 
DIQ.070) – either ‘don’t know’ or ‘refused’ response – and those whose insulin 
treatment period (DIQ.060) appeared longer than their time since diagnosis were 
excluded."

```{r}
#| label: step-1

#   DIQ.070) – either ‘don’t know’ or ‘refused’ response – and those whose insulin 
#   treatment period (DIQ.060) appeared longer than their time since diagnosis were 
#   excluded."
step_1 <- step_0 |> 
  mutate(
    # diq060: Numeric duration for years using insulin
    yrs_using_insulin = did060,
    # Flag those where their insulin treatment period exceeds their diab_duration
    flag_duration = case_when(
      yrs_using_insulin > diab_duration ~ 'Remove', 
      is.na(yrs_using_insulin) ~ 'Keep',  # these are ok to keep
      .default = 'Keep'
    )
  )

# Inspect those with the flag indicating they state to use insulin longer than diabetes
#   duration.

step_1d <- step_1 |> 
  filter(
    # diq050: Taking insulin now

    # flag_duration: report using insulin longer than diabetes duration
    flag_duration != 'Remove',
    # diq070: Take diabetic pills to lower blood sugar
    diq070 %in% c('Yes', 'No')
  )

# nrow(step_1)    # 4271
# nrow(step_1d)   # 4052 -- This is good since there were 219 (208+2+9) identified in the 
                  # janitor tabyls above! Good to move forward.
```

There were `r sum(step_1$flag_duration == 'Remove')` participants removed for indicating insulin
use longer than their reported duration of diabetes. There was/were also
`r sum(step_1$diq050 == "Don't know")` participant(s) removed for reporting "Don't know" for
DIQ.050 ("Taking insulin now") and `r sum(step_1$diq070 == "Don't know")` participants
removed for reporting "Don't know" for DIQ.070 ("Take diabetic pills to lower blood 
sugar").

<mark>The cohort was thereby reduced from `r nrow(step_1)` to `r nrow(step_1d)` participants who
fully met the inclusion criteria.</mark> This cohort will now be assessed for diabetes
classification.



### Step 2: Currently takes medication for diabetes

"Participants who replied ‘no’ to DIQ.050 and ‘no’ to DIQ.070, meaning that they were 
neither currently taking insulin nor an oral hypoglycemic agent, were assigned as T2D.
The rest were moved forward."

```{r}

      .default = 'continue'
    )
  )

st2_dx <- sum(step_2$step_2_var == 'T2D')
st2_dx_pct <- round((st2_dx / nrow(step_2)) * 100, 2)

diabetes during Step 2.</mark> The remaining `r sum(step_2$step_2_var != 'T2D')` will continue
through the classification algorithm.



### Step 3: Currently takes insulin

"Participants who replied ‘no’ to DIQ.050 and therefore were not currently taking 
insulin were assigned as T2D. The rest were moved forward."

```{r}
#| label: step-3

<mark>`r st3_dx` (`r st3_dx_pct`%) participants were newly identified as having Type II
diabetes during Step 3.</mark>
`r sum(step_3$step_3_var == 'already classified')` participants have been previously
classified in Step 2.
The remaining `r sum(step_3$step_3_var == 'continue')` participants that were not 
previously classified will continue through the classification algorithm.



### Step 4: Currently takes only insulin

"Participants who replied ‘yes’ to DIQ.050 and ‘yes’ to DIQ.070, meaning they were 
taking both insulin and an oral hypoglycemic agent, were assigned as T2D. The rest
were moved forward."

```{r}

<mark>`r st4_dx` (`r st4_dx_pct`%) participants were newly identified as having Type II
diabetes during Step 4.</mark> 
`r sum(step_4$step_4_var == 'already classified')` participants have been previously
classified in Step 2 or Step 3.
The remaining `r sum(step_4$step_4_var == 'continue')` participants that were not 
previously classified will continue through the classification algorithm.
