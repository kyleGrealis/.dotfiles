## Background

We've excluded the 2019-2020 cycle from our analysis, which is methodologically sound for
 the following reasons:

The 2019-2020 NHANES cycle was suspended in March 2020 due to COVID-19 before data 
collection was completed, resulting in data that are not nationally representative when 
analyzed as a standalone 2-year cycle. CDC addressed this by creating a special "2017-March 
2020 prepandemic" dataset, but this introduces complexity that could compromise our
 analysis.

## Why we're excluding it:

### 1. Maintaining consistent 2-year cycles

The combined 2017-March 2020 file merges what would normally be two distinct cycles, 
creating a 3-year period that doesn't align with the standard NHANES 2-year sampling 
framework. Including it would break the temporal consistency of our multi-cycle analysis.

### 2. Weight calculation complications

Our weighting methodology is designed for standard 2-year cycles (and the special 4-year 
weights for 1999-2001). The 2017-March 2020 combined file uses PSU-level adjustment 
factors and reassigned sampling strata, which would require a completely different 
weighting approach than the rest of our cycles.

### 3. Interpretability

Including a 3-year "cycle" among otherwise consistent 2-year cycles complicates trend 
interpretation and could confuse reviewers during peer review.

## Our approach

We're using complete, nationally representative 2-year cycles: 1999-2017 and 2021. This 
provides robust estimates across multiple cycles with consistent methodology and maximizes
analytical clarity.

## Alternative if needed

If the 2017-March 2020 data are critical, we could incorporate them, but this 
would require restructuring our entire weighting scheme and likely delaying the analysis.
